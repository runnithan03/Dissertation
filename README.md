# 📘 Equity Fund Profitability and Sustainability Modelling Using Multiple-Response Regression

This repository contains the code, data, and final report for my undergraduate dissertation at Durham University. The project investigates **Multiple-Response Regression (MRR)** models for predicting both profitability and sustainability metrics of equity funds, using a real-world dataset and advanced statistical and machine learning methods.

## 📄 Project Summary

**Title:** *Equity Fund Profitability and Sustainability Modelling Using Multiple-Response Regression*  
**Author:** Raul Unnithan  
**Supervisor:** Ric Crossman  
**Submitted:** May 2025  
**Department:** Mathematical Sciences, Durham University

This dissertation compares the effectiveness of multiple MRR models in predicting two correlated outcomes:  
- **Return on Equity (ROE)** (profitability)
- **Sustainability Score** (ESG performance)

The models include classical statistical methods, shrinkage approaches, and modern machine learning models, all evaluated using **Average Normalised Root Mean Square Error (ANRMSE)**.

## 🔍 Methods Used

### 📊 Statistical Models

- **Multiple-Response Linear Regression (MRLR)**  
- **Sequential MANOVA Stepwise Selection**  
  Custom implementation using Wilks' Lambda and ANRMSE  
- **Shrinkage Methods**  
  - Ridge Regression  
  - Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression  
  - Multivariate Regression with Covariance Estimation (MRCE)

### 🌲 Machine Learning Models

- **Random Forests** (via Multivariate Regression Trees & Covariance Regression)  
- **XGBoost** with Cholesky Decomposition for multivariate prediction

## 🧪 Dataset

- Sourced from Kaggle; filtered to include equity funds only  
- **1248 observations**, **12 predictor variables**
- **2 response variables**:
  - **Return on Equity (ROE)**  
  - **Sustainability Score** (Morningstar ESG rating)

**Preprocessing Includes:**
- Imputation via Random Forests & Linear Regression  
- Multivariate normality tested via Mardia's test  
- Multicollinearity checked using VIF

## 📈 Evaluation Metric

All models are compared using:
- **ANRMSE** (Average Normalised Root Mean Square Error)  
- Supplemented by **Wilks’ Lambda** for feature selection during stepwise procedures
