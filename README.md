# Multiple Response Regression - Dissertation Project  
**Author**: Raul Unnithan,
**Supervisor**: Ric Crossman,
**Institution**: Durham University  
**Course**: Mathematics and Statistics  
**Date**: April 2025  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on applying **Multiple Response Regression (MRR)** techniques using methods such as **Neural Networks and Random Forests** to predict multiple continuous response variables. The goal is to build predictive models for financial and sustainability metrics, more specifically **Return on Equity (ROE)** and **Sustainability Score**.
