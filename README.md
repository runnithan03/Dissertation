# 📘 Equity Fund Profitability and Sustainability Modelling Using Multiple-Response Regression

This repository contains the code, data, and final report for my undergraduate dissertation at Durham University. The project investigates **Multiple-Response Regression (MRR)** models for predicting both profitability and sustainability metrics of equity funds, using a real-world dataset and advanced statistical and machine learning methods.

## 📄 Project Summary

**Title:** *Equity Fund Profitability and Sustainability Modelling Using Multiple-Response Regression*  
**Author:** Raul Unnithan  
**Supervisor:** Ric Crossman  
**Submitted:** May 2025  
**Department:** Mathematical Sciences, Durham University

This dissertation compares the effectiveness of multiple MRR models in predicting two correlated outcomes:  
- **Return on Equity (ROE)** (profitability)
- **Sustainability Score** (ESG performance)

The models include classical statistical methods, shrinkage approaches, and modern machine learning models, all evaluated using **Average Normalised Root Mean Square Error (ANRMSE)**.
